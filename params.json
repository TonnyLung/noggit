{"body":"N o g g i t\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nNoggit is the world's fastest streaming JSON parser for Java.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n - Fast!  Measured as the fastest JSON parser on char[], String input.\r\n - Streaming API (StAX/pull-parser like) for both easy and efficient parsing\r\n - Conforms to the JSON standard: http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4627.txt\r\n - Memory efficiency\r\n    - incremental parsing (Reader-based) in order to handle huge messages\r\n    - a single byte of state needed per nested object or array\r\n    - does not read large objects (including primitives) completely into memory unless asked\r\n    - can eliminate most copying, allowing the user to provide the output buffer for values\r\n - can handle primitives of any size (does not attempt to parse\r\n   numerics into a certain language primitives unless asked)\r\n - Simple serialization of objects (List, Map, etc)\r\n - Optional creation of objects (List, Map, etc) when parsing.\r\n\r\n","name":"Noggit","tagline":"JSON streaming parser","note":"Don't delete this file!
